# Hardest-Wordle
## Overview
Hardest-Wordle is a Wordle variant designed to make word guessing as difficult as possible. Instead of choosing a fixed word, the program dynamically adapts to maximize the challenge based on user guesses.
### How It Works
1)Loads a list of five-letter words from an external source.  
2)The user makes a guess.  
3)Based on Wordle-like feedback (green, orange, grey), the program filters the word list.  
4)Selects the hardest word to guess next.  
5)Repeats until the word is guessed or attempts run out.
